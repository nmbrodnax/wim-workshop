#Introduction to Web Scraping with Python

##Abstract

Web scraping is a method of extracting and restructuring information from web pages.  This workshop will introduce basic techniques for web scraping using popular open-source tools.  The first part of the workshop will provide an overview of basic HTML elements and Python tools for developing a custom web scraper.  The second part will enable participants to practice accessing websites, parsing information, and storing data in a CSV file.  This workshop is intended for social scientists who are new to web scraping.  No programming experience is required, but basic familiarity with HTML and Python is helpful.
